# S-P-500---Toy-Model
Toy model, based on Geometric Brownian model
See (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) 

Two important variables correspond to rate of return and voltaility. First, guessed them by qualitatively matching with S&P500. Interestingly, later I looked in the literautre and others got empirical numbers from end-of-week historic data and it matched quite closely to my crude method.

Putting these numbers in I then looked over a 20 year span. I then tried to see if you can from the first 10 years guess what will happen in the next ten years. The curve fill in the 'cone of uncertainty' sometimes, but the cone could be really wide. 

This was just a toy model, however elements may be incorparated later for soemthing more sophisticated.
